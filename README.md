# Summary
My second web project with the addition of some Javascript this time around. This project helped me understand the relationship Javscript has with the DOM and techniques that are available to us in Vanilla JS to manipulate it. The Date object and its many properties was the key component of this project and updating this on the DOM was a fruitful learning experience. By using the setInterval() function I was able to implement a "ticking" for each portion of the time, most notably the seconds. That being said, my greatest challenge with this project was implementing the ticking functionality and debugging issues related to updating the time in the DOM. Overall, I enjoyed working with Javascript this time and being able to manipulate the state of the Date object was a valuable experience going forward with other projects!

- Detailed Features:
  - Used setInterval() method for implementing "ticking"
  - Logic for generating HH:MM:SS time format with leading 0's
  - Logic for appending suffix to day of the month, eg. 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th
